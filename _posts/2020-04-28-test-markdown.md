There used to be a time when Sports was just for leisure. There was no money attached, it was 
just for fun and some rivalry, and to brag about who is the champion of the town. Now, time has changed. Sports attract lots of people and there is a big reason behind it. We all know about the benefits of playing sports. It keeps us healthy, builds team spirit, builds leadership qualities, and makes people accountable for their roles in the team. Keeping all that aside, now there is an even better incentive for playing Sports. That is MONEY!!!  
We are all after Money, sports players are the same. Sports personalities these days are just not sports players, they are business-minded people. They look for the best compensation and endorsement. Compensation, we can look in two ways as there are different formats of sports. Individual sports like tennis, boxing, golf, etc, receive compensation based on their placement/wins in the tournament, whereas in the team sports it is about contracts and how much the contracts pay solely depends on individual players' worth and their demand in the market.   
Sports have a massive market around the world. People are fanatic about sports, and they spend a lot of money to buy tickets, jerseys, souvenirs, and many more items related to sports to support their favorite players or sports teams.
