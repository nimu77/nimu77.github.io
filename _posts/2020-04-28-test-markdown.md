There used to be time when Sports was just for leisure. There was no money attached, it was just for fun and some rivalry, and to brag about who is the champion of the town. Now, time has changed. Sports attract lots of people and there is a big reason behind it. We all know about the benefits of playing sports. It keeps up healthy, builds team spirit, builds leadership qualities, and makes people accountable for their roles in the team. Keeping all that aside, now there is even more bigger incentive for playing Sports. That is MONEY!!!

  We are all after Money, sports players are the same. Sports personalities these days are just not sports players, they are business minded people. They look for the best compensation and endorsement. Compensation, we can look in two ways as there are different formats of sports. Individual sports like tennis, boxing, golf, etc, receives compensation based on their placement/wins in the tournament, whereas in team sports it is about contracts and how much the contracts pays solely depends on individual players worth and their demand in the market. They are superstars of our society, people follow them and look upon them for motivation. 


You can write regular [markdown](http://markdowntutorial.com/) here and Jekyll will automatically convert it to a nice webpage.  I strongly encourage you to [take 5 minutes to learn how to write in markdown](http://markdowntutorial.com/) - it'll teach you how to transform regular text into bold/italics/headings/tables/etc.

**Here is some bold text**

## Here is a secondary heading

Here's a useless table:

| Number | Next number | Previous number |
| :------ |:--- | :--- |
| Five | Six | Four |
| Ten | Eleven | Nine |
| Seven | Eight | Six |
| Two | Three | One |


How about a yummy crepe?

It can also be centered!

![Crepe](https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/cQ1Yoa75m2yUFFbY2xwuqw/348s.jpg){: .center-block :}

Here's a code chunk:

~~~
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
~~~

And here is the same code with syntax highlighting:

```javascript
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
```

And here is the same code yet again but with line numbers:

{% highlight javascript linenos %}
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
{% endhighlight %}

## Boxes
You can add notification, warning and error boxes like this:

### Notification

{: .box-note}
**Note:** This is a notification box.

### Warning

{: .box-warning}
**Warning:** This is a warning box.

### Error

{: .box-error}
**Error:** This is an error box.
