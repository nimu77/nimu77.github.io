We are all after Money, sports players are the same. Sports personalities these days are just not sports players, they are business-minded people. They look for the best compensation and endorsement. Compensation, we can look in two ways as there are different formats of sports. Individual sports like tennis, boxing, golf, etc, receive compensation based on their placement/wins in the tournament, whereas in the team sports it is about contracts and how much the contracts pay solely depends on individual players' worth and their demand in the market.  

Sports have a massive market around the world. People are fanatic about sports, and they spend a lot of money to buy tickets, jerseys, souvenirs, and many more items related to sports to support their favorite players or sports teams. In this huge market of sports, there are athletes who make millions of money. How can certain players stand out amongst the rest and make more money than others?
