There used to be a time when Sports was just for leisure. There was no money attached, it was just for fun and some rivalry, and mostly for bragging rights. Now, time has changed. Sports attract lots of people around the world and there is a big reason behind it. We all know about the benefits of playing sports. It keeps us healthy, builds team spirit, builds leadership qualities, and makes people accountable for their roles in the team. Keeping all that aside, now there is an even better incentive for playing Sports. That is **MONEY!!!**. Sports is now like a religion, and athletes are like the symbol of God. We look upon them for motivation, inspiration, and that magical moment that will change our life for better. Today, we will look at the dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/pavanraj159/forbes-100-highest-paid-athletes-2018) for the top 100 highest-paid athletes in 2018. The main goal of this project is to find out how well American athletes are paid compared to the rest of the world and also to find out which sports, in particular, spends the most amount of money on players.  

The race is **ON**. Let's see how did American athletes do in 2018. Have you ever thought about how much the athletes make? Most of the kids in America dream about being the next Michael Jordan, Muhammad Ali, Alex Rodriguez, Peyton Manning, and the list goes on and on. In America, sports like Football, Basketball, Ice Hockey, Baseball, Boxing, and UFC are more popular. We certainly can say that American loves sports, now let see how well our players are compensated.

From this figure, the first thing we see we can see the long red bar, and coincidently he is an American boxer. If we go through every bar in the figure, 60% of players are Americans. What about in the top 100?

It looks like the U.S is the King of the Jungle, 65% from the top 100 highest-paid athletes are Americans. What makes the U.S so lucrative? Why are the athletes in the U.S getting paid more than other athletes around the world? I guess there might be various reasons for that, now letâ€™s look at the Sports that paid the most in the top 100 lists of highest-paid athletes.

These are the sports that represent the list of the top 100. In the context of America, looking at the figure above, why do you think American athletes dominated the list of top 100 highest-paid athletes of 2018? The top five sports that paid the most was Basketball, Football, Soccer, Boxing, and Baseball. Out of those five sports, four of them is a household name in America. As I have mentioned before that kids in America dream about being the next Jordan or Ali. The reason why kids want to become the next Jordan or Ali is that these sports will bring them fame and money.  

So, the winner of the Rumble in the Jungle for 2018 is the U.S. The sports that are popular in the U.S dominates the list in the top 100, hence the athletes from the U.S also dominates the list of the top 100 highest-paid athletes of 2018. That being said, I am nowhere near saying that athletes in the U.S make more money or these particular sports spend more money on players. Overall, the picture might be different. This result is just for the top 100 highest-paid athletes.
