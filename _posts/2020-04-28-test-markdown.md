We are all after Money, sports players are the same. Sports personalities these days are just not sports players, they are business-minded people. They look for the best compensation and endorsement. Compensation, we can look in two ways as there are different formats of sports. Individual sports like tennis, boxing, golf, etc, receive compensation based on their placement/wins in the tournament, whereas in the team sports it is about contracts and how much the contracts pay solely depends on individual players' worth and their demand in the market.
