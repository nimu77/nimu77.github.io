We all believe in liberty, equality, and justice; those are the core values of democracy and America believes in it. The organization that I got to work with was Human Rights First, they are a non-profit organization who engages themselves for the betterment of society. They are in existence to challenge America to live up to its ideals, whenever the government and private companies fail to respect human rights and the rule of law they step in to demand justice, accountability, and reform.
I was so grateful to be part of the team that was assisting Human Rights First (HRF). I worked in finding data for police use of force, where human rights were being violated. Data can be so powerful to relay messages and show the world how our rights are being taken away from us. Our forefathers fought a great battle through experience and thought of many generations to draw up a constitution for the United States of America. If people in power fail to support the constitution, thatâ€™s when HRF steps in. After I was able to get some data related to police use of force, I had to make data relevant to the user story that we as a team was trying to solve. We wanted to solve a problem where users can easily view incidents where human rights were violated through an interactive map where they can select location, date, and types of use of force.

You can write regular [markdown](http://markdowntutorial.com/) here and Jekyll will automatically convert it to a nice webpage.  I strongly encourage you to [take 5 minutes to learn how to write in markdown](http://markdowntutorial.com/) - it'll teach you how to transform regular text into bold/italics/headings/tables/etc.

**Here is some bold text**

## Here is a secondary heading

Here's a useless table:

| Number | Next number | Previous number |
| :------ |:--- | :--- |
| Five | Six | Four |
| Ten | Eleven | Nine |
| Seven | Eight | Six |
| Two | Three | One |


How about a yummy crepe?



It can also be centered!

![Crepe](https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/cQ1Yoa75m2yUFFbY2xwuqw/348s.jpg){: .center-block :}

Here's a code chunk:

~~~
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
~~~

And here is the same code with syntax highlighting

```javascript
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
```

And here is the same code yet again but with line numbers:

{% highlight javascript linenos %}
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
{% endhighlight %}

## Boxes
You can add notification, warning and error boxes like this:

### Notification

{: .box-note}
**Note:** This is a notification box.

### Warning

{: .box-warning}
**Warning:** This is a warning box.

### Error

{: .box-error}
**Error:** This is an error box.
