We all believe in liberty, equality, and justice; those are the core values of democracy and America believes in it. The organization that I got to work with was Human Rights First, they are a non-profit organization who engages themselves for the betterment of society. They are in existence to challenge America to live up to its ideals, whenever the government and private companies fail to respect human rights and the rule of law they step in to demand justice, accountability, and reform.

I was so grateful to be part of the team that was assisting Human Rights First (HRF). I worked in finding data for police use of force, where human rights were being violated. Data can be so powerful to relay messages and show the world how our rights are being taken away from us. Our forefathers fought a great battle through experience and thought of many generations to draw up a constitution for the United States of America. If people in power fail to support the constitution, thatâ€™s when HRF steps in. After I was able to get some data related to police use of force, I had to make data relevant to the user story that we as a team was trying to solve. We wanted to solve a problem where users can easily view incidents where human rights were violated through an interactive map where they can select location, date, and types of use of force.

After finalizing the user stories, we as a team broke down user stories into shippable tasks. Since this was a cross-functional product, user stories were broken down into tasks that can be handled by data scientists, frontend, and backend. Here is the trello card for one of the user story.

For Data Scientists, we broke down tasks into parts where we had to scrape relevant data, explore data, do data engineering, finalize data to showcase the timeline of use of force, create endpoints to transfer data, build a Postgresql database on AWS RDS, and connect to it to have a highly stable database that safely stores data.

### Technical challenges and difficulties

This was an exciting project for me and for my teammates. To get to work with Human Rights First and help them on their journey of educating people of their rights and showcasing incidents that involved police use of force to show records to support how people have been mistreated and abused was a challenge, but that challenge brought the best out of everyone. I specifically worked on getting a route to communicate the timeline of police use of force within America.

For me personally, I was having technical difficulty connecting to the PostgreSQL in AWS RDS. I was wary of how I can connect to the database from                              various platforms like command prompt, and VS Code tool for PostgreSQL, which I tried but I was having trouble populating it with tables and data                                that I have acquired. Finally, after many trials and errors and searching on the internet for similar problems, I was able to use a management tool                              for PostgreSQL called pdAdmin.
