title: About me
subtitle: Student of Data Science at Lambda School
---

Hi, I am **Nirmal Thapa**. I am currently in Lambda School learning Data Science. Beside being a data science student, which takes most of time, but in my free time I love to work out, go for a hike, mountain bike, play tennis, and  run. One day, I would love to work remotely, so that I can travel and work at the same time.   

In this website, I will be sharing my personal projects. Data Science is a new field for me. I am rookie, as far as Data Science is concerned, but here I am to change to myself and learn these valuable skills. I am learner, so I am open to any suggestions and feedbacks. Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions or suggestions for me. Email would be the best way to get in touch with me.
