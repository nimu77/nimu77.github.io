###1. U.S. vs the Rest of the World (Top 100 Highest-Paid Athletes of 2018)  

Sports have been an incredible invention for human beings. When we say, not everyone can swim or not everyone can climb a tree, we mean that
we all have different talents. So, Sports has been a great platform for athletes to show their talent and give hopes to kids that one day
they can do the same. But, nowadays sports has been even more attractive as it pays handsomely to athletes who are great in their particular 
sports. This project is about showing who earned the most between athletes in the U.S. and the rest of the world in the list of top 100 
highest-paid athletes of 2018 and also to show which sports spent the most on players.
